# Repo for hosting website
Work in progress. Let's get this revamp done!

# Deploying local website
1. Run the script `./install-dependencies.bat` to install node modules.
2. Run the script `./deploy-local-site.bat` to compile the website and host it. The URL for website access will be displayed in the terminal, use the 'Local' address.
    - As long as you keep the terminal window open, the local website will remain online. It will even automatically refresh the website for you every time you edit a file in obsidian or save changes to one in another editor. Close the terminal to shut it down.
